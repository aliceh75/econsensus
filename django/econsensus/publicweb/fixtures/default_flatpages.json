            "content": "# About Econsensus\r\n\r\nEconsensus is an open-source web-based tool to help organisations to track decisions that they make, and also to discuss proposals for new decisions online. Econsensus is specifically tailored to be useful to organisations using a consensus decision making framework, however is flexible enough to be useful to any organisation.\r\n\r\nAs of December 2011 we have been hosting Econsensus \u201cas-is\u201d for free to individuals and groups that would like to take a look at it and maybe start using it. You can sign up for free, create an account for your organisation and try out Econsensus by clicking the above link.  If you\u2019re technically minded then you can also download the code, contribute to the project, or  make your own changes \u2013 see the developers\u2019 guide below.\r\n\r\n## Consensus decision making\r\n\r\n\u2026is a formal process used by many organisations, including Aptivate, which aims to ensure that all voices are heard in a decision. Although Econsensus specifically supports this framework, it can be used in any organisation to track and discuss decisions and issues. For more info on consensus decision making, see [http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consensus](http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consensus), or there are a variety of other internet resources on the topic.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nEconsensus has a range of functionality such as:\r\n\r\n* records decisions made, along with related data such as meeting info, feedback given, action points and next steps, review and expiry dates.\r\n* records proposals that are in progress, and allows users to register various kinds of feedback e.g. \u201ccomment\u201d, \u201cconsent\u201d, \u201cdanger\u201d \u201cquestion\u201d etc.\r\n* view lists of decisions or proposals with sortable relevant fields e.g. deadlines, reviews\r\n* archive decision discussions that never made it into policy\r\n* discussion area for pre-proposal thinking, to work out the salient points of an issue\r\n* easily link to external documents and other resources\r\n* email interface \u2013 receive updates and make contributions by email\r\n* admin user interface to add new users and email addresses and modify system items.\r\n\r\n\u2026and we are planning several improvements in the future such as full tagging and searching functionality; user-defined groups; a dashboard of recent changes relevant to each user; customised notifications; and whatever else is useful to us and others using the system! Econsensus is a work in progress and new improvements and features are deployed every month or so.\r\n\r\n## Using Econsensus\r\n\r\nThere is a basic introductory [user guide](../help) available. We would welcome feedback about anything that could be clearer about using the system!\r\n\r\nPeople who are interested in discussing possible features for Econsensus are encouraged to join the *discussion* *mailing* *list* at [https://groups.google.com/group/econsensusdiscuss](https://groups.google.com/group/econsensusdiscuss) and ask questions or make points there. This is monitored by several Aptivate staff and volunteers, and we recommend that this is the first place to ask questions. It\u2019s also possible to see the group\u2019s history to read previous questions or see how thinking about the project has developed etc.\r\n\r\n## Demo version\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re not ready to create an account and would like to try the system, you can access a \u201csandbox\u201d public demo of Econsensus by logging into [http://www.econsensus.org](http://www.econsensus.org) with username: \u201ctest\u201d, password: \u201ctest\u201d . You can safely try out anything you like in here.\r\n\r\nBecause the sandbox is a public version, you won\u2019t see some functionality e.g. anything to do with sending email notifications, or the admin interface, but you should get the idea.\r\n\r\n## Work on Econsensus with us!\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019re technically minded and would like to contribute to the development of the software, see our [developers\u2019 guide](volunteering) to getting started with Econsensus."

            "content": "# Econsensus Manual\r\n\r\nHelp us write this manual!\r\n\r\nThis user manual is very much a work in progress at the moment so please do let us know if you do have any questions or think anything could be more clear. To contact us, email econsensus-info [at] aptivate.org .\r\n\r\n## Inviting new users\r\n\r\nOnce you have been set up with an instance of Econsensus for your organisation, one of your first jobs will be to invite other users. This can be done from the Admin screen, linked to in your list of organisations when you log in, and also linked to in the top right of the screen while you are using the system. While the interface is a bit rough and ready at the moment, we hope it makes sense! All you have to do is enter an email address, and select whether you want that user to also be an admin (able to invite more users) or not. The person will then receive an email notifying them of the invitation, and inviting them to sign up, as you did.\r\n\r\n## Econsensus email integration\r\n\r\n### Email notifications\r\n\r\nWhenever someone makes a new proposal, or changes the state of a proposal, or adds new feedback, everyone except the person making the change will be sent an email about it. People can manually opt-out of these email notifications by editing a proposal and un-checking the \u201cwatch\u201d tick-box found next to the \u201csave\u201d button. The default is that everyone receives everything, as they would if you were simply using email to discuss decisions.\r\n\r\n### Email threading\r\n\r\nWe are working on making sure that the emails sent out can be threaded if you use e.g. gmail or an email client that allows threading, so that people can group their emails together more easily and are less likely to drown in chat from the system.\r\nSending feedback by email\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s also possible to leave feedback in Econsensus by replying to the emails that are sent out rather than using the web interface. Instructions for doing this are contained within the emails that are sent. Basically, if you just hit reply and type whatever you feel like, you will leave a Comment by default. If you start your email with a type of feedback e.g. \u201cQuestion:\u201d or \u201cConcern:\u201d then it will be recorded as that kind of feedback.\r\n\r\nIt\u2019s probably helpful to delete any quoted text from emails before sending them.\r\n\r\n### Sending proposals by email\r\n\r\nIt is possible to create proposals by email. Simply send an email to [your-organisation-name]@econsensus.org *  with the word: \u201cproposal\u201d in the subject line, and the content of the proposal in the email body. Econsensus will use the first line of the email as the title of the proposal. If you want to add other bits of specific information to the proposal such as budgets or deadlines, that appear in their own field in the web interface, these cannot be specified by email and must be added through the web interface.\r\n\r\n\\* this is the same email address that you will receive Econsensus emails from.\r\n\r\n## Exporting your data\r\n\r\nIt is possible to export all your data stored in Econsensus to .csv file, which is compatible with most spreadsheet programs. The data is output in a format that is intended to be most useful when looked at on a spreadsheet page by a human, not to be read into some other system by a computer. However, all the data is there, so you can do with it what you want. We are keen to make sure that if you store your data on Econsensus, you can get it out again! If you have specific data exporting requirements, let us know.\r\n\r\n## Using this Econsensus prototype version\r\n\r\nWe want to make it clear that this system is currently a prototype, and we can\u2019t guarantee anything functionality-wise or security-wise. We are however using Econsensus ourselves, and as far as we know, it works just fine. We\u2019re offering it as-is to groups at this stage so that people can help us work out how to meet their needs better, and spot the missing bits or rough patches that we need to iron out. We would really really welcome any feedback. We take regular backups of the data stored in the system, and we believe it is pretty safe to keep your data on it! We keep ours there.\r\n\r\n## Security and confidentiality\r\n### Code security checking in prototype version\r\n\r\nWe will want to do a thorough code check before we make it officially live, to look for security holes, e.g. can someone in another organisation see your organisation\u2019s data? We don\u2019t think so, but we want to be very sure.\r\n\r\n### Debugging and error-finding\r\n\r\nBecause Aptivate are responsible for fixing problems in the system, and because we have an admin interface to the whole system, one of us might want to take a look at the live system while fixing a bug, and end up seeing an admin page with bits of several organisations\u2019 data on it. We are committed to keeping your information confidential.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nAll in all, we suggest you don\u2019t store anything in here for now that would make you or your organisation very vulnerable if someone else saw it \u2013 and generally this isn\u2019t a bad rule for use of all online systems, maybe just especially this one until we say \u201cit is now an officially-live service\u201d. If you\u2019re doing something super-secret, probably best to figure out a super-secret way of talking about it, and don\u2019t use this system for that!\r\nAND\u2026 we use this system for our own work!\r\n\r\nHaving said all of the above, just to reiterate, here at Aptivate we trust this same Econsensus system that we are offering to you. We trust it enough to use it to make and track our own decisions from around the start of 2012, and we haven\u2019t had any real problems so far, or worries about our data leaking out to inadvertent eyes. We control the server it is hosted on and we are committed to keeping your data confidential, even if we see any of it while fixing something else in the guts of the system. We know that there are some slightly rough edges in the system, however there\u2019s nothing that looks like a serious bug to us. We\u2019d be very happy to hear and talk through any concerns you have about your data security if you start using this system.\r\n"

            "content": "# Work on Econsensus with us\r\n\r\nEconsensus is the main project that we\u2019re inviting potential volunteers to work on with us at the moment. Volunteer effort, notably from Paul Backhouse, Matthew Simpson, Sarah Bird and Jo Paulger (thanks folks!) has been fundamental to getting the codebase to where it is. If you\u2019re interested in either collaborating remotely on this project or working with us in one of our offices, we\u2019d be very happy to hear from you.\r\n\r\n## Technologies\r\n\r\nEconsensus is written in Python using the Django web development framework. To collaborate on the project you\u2019ll need to engage to some degree with Python/Django, and probably at least a touch of HTML/CSS. Suggested tutorials are listed below.\r\n\r\nWe generally write code using a test-driven development approach, where we write tests for a feature before developing the code, so testing is especially important to us. It\u2019s worth looking into this a bit if you\u2019ve never done it before.\r\n\r\nWe use mainly Ubuntu systems in the office, so if you\u2019d like to work with us there, if you can practice developing on an Ubuntu system (it\u2019s easy to set up a dual boot system on a Windows system using an Ubuntu installation disc), that would be great!\r\n\r\nSome people use Eclipse \u2013 [http://www.eclipse.org/](http://www.eclipse.org/) \u2013 as a development environment; other people hack out code in their favourite text editor; it\u2019s up to you what you do.\r\n\r\n## Source control\r\n\r\nAs an open source project, the Econsensus code is kept on Github at [https://github.com/aptivate/econsensus](https://github.com/aptivate/econsensus) \u2013 note that we tend to use our own internal tools for recording and prioritising features and bugs. We use Git as a version control / code repository system. Other members of the team will be able to help you get set up with using Git if you want \u2013 it\u2019s considered useful for multiple people collaborating on projects, and can be a bit complex to learn at first. There\u2019s a \u201cbootcamp\u201d tutorial at [http://help.github.com/](http://help.github.com/) \u2013 at least one of our team has found this useful for getting to grips with the Git core concepts.\r\n\r\nOnce you\u2019ve got the basic concepts of git and github, here\u2019s how we do things on Econsensus:\r\n\r\nWe keep the \u2018master\u2019 branch of the project releasable to our live server at all times, so all new work and fixes should be done on a branch of the \u2018develop\u2019 branch. Then at some stage we\u2019ll merge your branch into the main \u2018develop\u2019 branch, and release this to the staging (i.e. testing) server. When all changes have been tested on the staging server, they all get merged into master and released onto the live server. So, in order to be able to submit changes you\u2019ll need to fork the develop branch into your own github account, clone it on your machine, create a new branch, and work on that. Once you\u2019ve finished, you make a pull request through github, which tells us to review and integrate your code. There is a detailed guide explaining this kind of process at [https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/github-workflow-for-submitting-pull-requests](https://openshift.redhat.com/community/wiki/github-workflow-for-submitting-pull-requests)\r\n\r\n## Discussion list\r\n\r\nThere is a discussion group where people ask questions about deploying, working on, or using the system at [http://groups.google.com/group/econsensusdiscuss](http://groups.google.com/group/econsensusdiscuss) \u2013 we recommend that this is the first place to ask questions, including \u201cwhat can I be working on?\u201d. Several members of Aptivate staff are on it and will be very happy to help as much as they can.\r\n\r\n## Tutorials\r\n\r\nThe Python / Django tutorials that our tech team recommend are:\r\n\r\nPython tutorial: [http://docs.python.org/tutorial/](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/)\r\n\r\nOther Python material: [http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html](http://diveintopython.org/toc/index.html)\r\n\r\nDjango tutorial: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/intro/tutorial01/)\r\n\r\nDjango testing tutorial: [https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/testing/](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/testing/)\r\n\r\nand there will be lots more resources out there.\r\n\r\nFor HTML and CSS, we recommend this site as a source of info: [http://htmldog.com/](http://htmldog.com/) \u2013 it seems to assume that you\u2019re using Windows, however the general principles apply on any OS."
